This site is intented to be a virtual artpiece concerned about the rate of human meat consumption. 
The author is mainly plant-forward and not against meat consumption as long as consumers have a clear understanding of the sacrafice of the animal world for each meal of ours. 
Consumers are detached from the reality of the meat industry.
The rates are a not nearly perfect and will be adjusted, this is a work in progress site.
